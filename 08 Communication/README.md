# Communication

So far we've assumed agents observe actions but don't communicate directly. This section explores when and how communication matters in strategic settings.

## A - Doing by Talking I (Cheap Talk)

Does communication before the game change things? For Prisoner's Dilemma: well, no. Regardless of what both players say, they will each still choose to defect. Cheap talk is communication that's costless and non-binding.

In games with multiple equilibria (Battle of the Sexes), cheap talk can help coordinate. You can see that doing the opposite of what was said is an equilibrium too... How confusing! Giotto's thought: communication is probably only applicable in repeated games.

## B - Talking by Doing (Signalling Games)

Signalling games involve private information and costly signals. Education signals ability, warranties signal quality, peacock tails signal fitness. Unlike cheap talk, signals are credible because they're costly. Separating vs pooling equilibria determine whether information is revealed.

## C - Doing by Talking II (Speech-Act Theory)

Speech-act theory studies how utterances perform actions. Some communication is self-committing (creates obligations) or self-revealing (credibly reveals information). Examples: burning bridges, public announcements, contracts. Connection to mechanism design.
