    "Here we begin to look at how self-interested individuals interact with one another. For now this will focus on noncooperative game theory, where the modelling unit will be the individual, but there is also coalitional game theory, in which the modelling unit is the group, which will be explored later.\n",

    "When we talk about self-interested agents we are talking about individuals with a capability to engage in different actions which can effect the world, and who have preferences about what the world looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good start for making this more concrete is utility theory. With utility theory we put a numerical value on each state of the world. \n",

    "Say that I have a soccer ball. I can choose to play with it at home, or go to the park. If I go to the park I waste a lot of time walking there and back, but I might bump into my friend George, who would be great fun. Say that my value of being at home is 5, going to the park without George is 0, and going with George is 15. George has a 50:50 chance of being at the park. What should I do?\n",

    "### 3.2.1 Justifiying utility theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Utility comes about as a result of thinking about preferences for outcomes. The theory follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a set of outcomes $O$. Then for two outcomes $o_1, o_2 \\in O$ we can define let $o_1 \\succ o_2$ denote that there is a preference for $o_1$. You can guess what $\\succeq and \\sim$ mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lottery is a random selection of an outcome, based on a probability distribution. We consider the lotteries to be outcomes in themselves, so the preference relation applies to them too.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we can get the axioms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completeness:** $\\forall o_1,o_2 \\in O, o_1 \\succ o_2$ or $o_2 \\succ o_1$ or $o_1 \\sim o_2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transitivity:** If $o_1 \\succ o_2$ and $o_2 \\succ o_3$ then $o_1 \\succ o_3$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Substitutibility:** If $o_1 \\sim o_2$ the value of a lottery substituting $o_1$ for $o_2$ or vice versa is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P_l(o_i)$ denote the probability of $o_i$ given lottery $l$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decomposability:** If the probability of all outcomes is the same under lottery $l_1$ and $l_2$ then $l_1 \\sim l_2$. This is included to say that if I have a 50:50 between A and (another lottery with a 50:50 between B and C), that this is the same as a 50:25:25 between A, B, and C together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monotonicity:** If $o_1 \\succ o_2$ and $p > q$ then $[p:o_1,(1-p):o_2]\\succ [q:o_1,(1-q):o_2]$. I.e., more of a good outcome is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these we can generate an interesting Lemma:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemma 3.1.6:** If a preference relation satisfies the above, and if $o_1\\succ o_2$ and $o_2\\succ o_3$, then there is some probability $p$ such that for all $p^{\\prime}<p$ then $o_2 \\succ [p^{\\prime}: o_1; (1-p^{\\prime}):o_3]$ and for all $p^{\\prime\\prime}>p$ then $[p^{\\prime\\prime}: o_1; (1-p^{\\prime\\prime}):o_3] \\succ o_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "What this lemma says is that for any three outcomes there is a single probability at which I am indifferent between the middle outcome and the lottery of the other two outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Proof:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets call $[p: o_1; (1-p):o_3]$ as $\\ell(p)$. There must be some $p_\\text{low}$ such that $o_2 \\succ \\ell(p_\\text{low})$. This is because $o_2 \\succ o_3$, and we could have $p_\\text{low}=0$. By montonicity we have that $\\ell(p^{\\prime})<\\ell(p_\\text{low})$ if $p^{\\prime}<p_\\text{low}$. By transitivity we then get $\\forall p^{\\prime}\\leq p_\\text{low}$, $o_2 \\succ \\ell(p^{\\prime})$ (eq 1). Applying the same logic to some $\\ell(p_\\text{high})\\succ o_2$ gives us a similar result that $\\forall p^{\\prime\\prime}\\geq p_\\text{high}$, $\\ell(p^{\\prime\\prime}) \\succ o_2$ (eq 2). Essentially we know that for $p$ from $0$ to some $p_\\text{low}$ we have that $o_2\\succ \\ell(p)$ and for $p$ from some $p_\\text{high}$ to $1$ we have that $\\ell(p)\\succ o_2$.$\n",
    "\n",
    "What we don't yet know is about the space between $p_\\text{low}$ and $p_\\text{high}$. Consider $p^\\star=(p_\\text{low}+p_\\text{high})/2$. Say $p^\\star\\sim o_2$. Then $p^\\star$ is unique, as if there was another $p^\\prime$ for which $p^\\prime\\sim o_2$ then $\\ell(p^\\star)\\sim \\ell(p^\\prime)$, which violates montonicity when you know $o_1\\succ o_3$. Now we need to prove the rest of the lemma. Say there is some $p^\\prime < p^\\star$. Then we need to prove that $o_2 \\succ \\ell(p^\\prime)$. We can do this by contradiction, imagining $\\ell(p^\\prime) \\succ o_2$ instead. Then for every point $\\hat{p}>p^\\prime$, it must be $\\ell(\\hat{p})\\succ o_2$ (from eq 2), which contradicts $p^\\star\\sim o_2$. The same argument applies the other way too. Finally, if it isn't true that $p^\\star\\sim o_2$ then we can refine either $p_\\text{low} = p^\\star$ or $p_\\text{high} = p^\\star$. This continues until we arrive at a unique value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuity:** If $o_1 \\succ o_2$ and $o_2 \\succ o_3$ then $\\exists p\\in [0,1]$ such that $o_2\\sim [p: o_1; (1-p:o_3]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we accept these axioms then we arrive at the von Neumann and Morgenstern theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem 3.1.8:** If a preference relation satisfies these axioms, then there is a function $u: O \\rightarrow [0,1]$ with the properties that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $u(o_1)\\geq u(o_2) \\iff o_1 \\succeq o_2$\n",
    "2. $u([p_1:o_1,....,p_k:o_k])=\\sum_{i=1}^kp_iu(o_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a proof, but I am getting tired of writing maths! The point of it all has been to show that utility is grounded in the maths of preferences. "
