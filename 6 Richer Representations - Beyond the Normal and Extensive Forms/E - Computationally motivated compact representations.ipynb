    "## 6.5 Computationally motivated compact representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously many games can be condensed and distilled, often in ways which make finding equilibria easier. For example, consider any board game. There are several different things we can look at in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5.1 The expected utility problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a game, a mixed strategy profile, and a player, we often want to know what their expected utility will be. In a normal-form game the answer is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{a\\in A}u_i(a)\\prod_{j=1}^ns_j(a_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I.e., a mixture of the outcomes weighed by the probability given by each player's strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately this grows exponentially in the number of actions and the number of players. Fortunately in the normal-form version of the game we already have the table computed, and so it's fairly trivial. However, if we do some compression / smaller representation of the game this benefit goes away. We ideally want to avoid turning our representation into the full normal-form.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ways to compress the information about payoffs, but the challenge is how to make sure that compression can be used to get expected utility in an efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5.2 Polynomial type\n",
    "\n",
    "A game has a polynomial type if the number of agents and the size of the action sets are polynomially bounded in the size of the representation. Most games so far in normal form have looked like this. As an example of a game which is not polynomially bounded consider a game where players can choose who to form a group with and then receive some payoffs depending on how many people are in the group. The representation can just be the payoffs per-group-size. E.g., [0,2,3] specifies a game involving 3 people. If the action a player takes is to form a group, specifying the other people, then the number of actions is equal to all the combinations of people. Combinations grow $2^n$, so the number of actions is exponential with the representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 6.5.3\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a nice theorem that if a game is polynomial type and expected utility can be computed in polynomial time then the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium can be reduced to the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a two-player normal-form game that is only polynomially larger. As finding a 2-player Nash equilibrium is PPAD-complete, so this is too. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a positive result, as it means we can compute Nash equilibria on a potentially smaller order of problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congestion games (from the previous section) don't satisfy these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 6.5.4\n",
    "\n",
    "While in general extensive-form games don't have polynomial type, when we restrict ourselves to just considering behavioural strategies we arrive at a similar positive result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing a Nash equilibrium in behavioural strategies for an extensive-form game can be polynomially reduced to findind a Nash equilibrium in a two-player normal form game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general fast solving for expected utility is a big deal, not just for theoretical algorithms, but for practical ones too. It's also relevant to other solution concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theorem 6.5.5\n",
    "\n",
    "If a game representation has polynomial type and has a polynomial algorithm for computing expected utility, then a correlated equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time too.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important result! There is a proof which is also worth looking at."

We do this by checking whether the decision at one node is strategically relevant to the decision at another.

We can just optimise what happens at that node given PoisonTree and TreeDoctor.\n",
