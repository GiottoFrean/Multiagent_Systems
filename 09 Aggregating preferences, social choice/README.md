# Aggregating Preferences, Social Choice

It is often difficult to measure true utilities. One alternative is to ask about preferences instead (i.e., do you prefer A or B). The downside is you lose a huge amount of information. I am not so interested in this! Preferences are dumb...

## A - Models and Voting, Social Functions, Ranking Systems

A social choice function maps individual preferences to a collective outcome. Condorcet winner: beats every other candidate in pairwise votes, but doesn't always exist! You can have cycles.

Common voting systems: Plurality (spoiler effects), Borda count (manipulable), instant runoff (non-monotonic), approval voting (loses ranking info), range/quadratic voting.

Arrow's impossibility theorem: No social choice function can simultaneously satisfy Pareto efficiency, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and non-dictatorship. This seems to pour cold water on voting systems altogether.

The best is quadratic voting, and nothing much more needs to be said!
