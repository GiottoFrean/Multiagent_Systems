    "## 3.3 Analysing games: from optimality to equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at games there are two fundamental solution concepts: Pareto optimality and Nash equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.1 Pareto Optimality\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key questions we would like to know is whether one solution to a game is better than another. Obviously, we could just add the utility if the utility scale is the same across all agents, but any utility function as defined earlier encompasses the same information about preferences as the same utility function scaled and shifted ($a x + b$), so we might want to define another concept of \"better\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy profile $s$ is Pareto dominant over another strategy $\\hat{s}$ if for all $i\\in N$, $u_i(s)\\geq u_i(\\hat{s})$, with a $j$ such that $u_j(s)>u_j(\\hat{s})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, in a Pareto dominant strategy some agent can be made better off without decreasing another's utiltiy. This gives us a partial ordering of all solutions (note, here we are talking about strategies in the general way as a lottery over actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy is Pareto optimal if it itself is not Pareto dominated by any other strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every game will always have a Pareto optimal strategy, and there is always at least 1 Pareto optimal strategy which is pure for every agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we return to the Prisoners Dilemma from before we can see that there are three Pareto optimal strategies (C-C, C-D, D-C). In each of these cases there is no alternative which doesn't decrease at least 1 players utility. The only option which is not pareto optimal is D-D, as it can be beaten by C-C:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n",
    "\\text{} & \\text{C} & \\text{D} \\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "\\text{C} & 5,5 & 0,8 \\\\\n",
    "\\text{D} & 8,0 & 2,2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.2 Defining best response and Nash equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the actions of other agents it is fairly straightforward to calculate what you should do - find the solution set that maximises your utility. If this solution set has a support of at least 2 actions you must be indifferent between them (as if one action was slightly better you would rather more of that).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy profile $s=(s_1,s_2,...,s_n)$ is in Nash equilibrium if for all agents $i$, $s_i$ is the best response to $s_{-i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that no agent can improve their situation by changing actions. This is sometimes called a *stable* strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the actions for each agent are uniquely the best (no substitutibility), then we say the strategy is in *strict* Nash equilbirum. If there are substitutes, then we say it is in *weak* equilibrium. All mixed strategies are weak, as the actions are the same value, and so it doesn't matter what the probabilities are. Pure games have either a strict or several weak equilibria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.3 Finding Nash equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the battle of the sexes problem from before, we can see it has two weak Nash equilibria at A-A and B-B:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n",
    "\\text{} & \\text{A} & \\text{B} \\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "\\text{A} & 2,1 & 0,0 \\\\\n",
    "\\text{B} & 0,0 & 1,2 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular game also has a mixed strategy equilbiria. In order to find it we need to choose each player's probability such that the other player is indifferent between their actions. If this is the case for all players, then all players can't improve their actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this imagine player 1 above (rows) chooses A with probability $p$ and B with probability $1-p$. Then we need to choose $p$ such that player 2 is indifferent between A and B. To player 2 (columns) the expected utility of going A is $1p+0(1-p)$. The expected utility of going B is $0p+2(1-p)$. In making these equal we get $p=\\frac{2}{3}$. Likewise when we do the same for player 2 we get $p=\\frac{1}{3}$. So, when the two probabilities are $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{3}$ respectively both players are indifferent between their actions, so we have a nash equilibrium. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe an easier way to see this is with the Matching Pennies problem, where each player chooses H or T and player 1 wins if they match, player 2 if not. The table is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n",
    "\\text{} & \\text{H} & \\text{T} \\\\\n",
    "\\hline\n",
    "\\text{H} & 1,-1 & -1,1 \\\\\n",
    "\\text{T} & -1,1 & 1,-1 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to see that there is no pure equilibrium. If we play H-H, then player 2 will change and we will be playing H-T. But then player 1 will change and we will be playing T-T, but then player 2 will change and we will get T-H, finally then player 1 changes and we get back to H-H.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a mixed strategy equilibrium. We can apply the same maths as before. If player 1 chooses H with probability $p$, the utility of player 2 for going H is $-1p+1(1-p)$ and the utility for going T is $1p-1(1-p)$. Making these equal we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "-1p+1(1-p)&=1p-1(1-p) \\\\\n",
    "p&=1/2\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is what you would expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3.4 Proving Nash equilibria\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite involved! In the 2 player, 2 action cases before it is pretty clear. See the book for the maths."
