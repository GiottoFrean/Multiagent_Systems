    "### The scheduling problem and integer programming\n",
    "In the previous section we looked at the assignment problem, which had a linear programming solution, but also a multiagent solution based on the idea of auctions and competitive equilibrium. Now we'll look at a more complicated scenario where multiple objects can be given to someone. The problem can still be stated as a linear program, but the answers will no longer be integers, hence the need for integer programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a scheduling problem we have a set $N$ of $n$ agents, a set $X$ of $m$ discrete and consecutive time slots, a value function $v$ for assigning a combination of time slots to an agent, and a price $q$ to use each time slot for some other purpose (this is optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "The value function says that a value of $w_i$ is generated if the number of timeslots assigned to agent $i$ is at least $\\lambda_i$ (some measure of the time needed) before $d_i$ (the deadline).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this problem, where we have 5 hour-long timeslots (9AM,10AM,11AM,12PM,1PM), and no alternative uses:\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has a solution, which can be worked out by first putting $C$ at the end (as nothing else will be using that last slot) and then seeing out that of the other options the best is $B$ and $E$:\n",

    "\n",
    "First of all, the problem can be written as an integer program, where $S$ is the set of all possible subsets of $X$, and $x_{i,s}$ refers to the variable saying if agent $i$ was assigned to $s\\in S$.\n",
