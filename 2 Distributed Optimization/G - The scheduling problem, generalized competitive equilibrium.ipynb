    "### 2.3.3 The scheduling problem and integer programming\n",
    "In the previous section we looked at the assignment problem, which had a linear programming solution, but also a multiagent solution based on the idea of auctions and competitive equilibrium. Now we'll look at a more complicated scenario where multiple objects can be given to someone. The problem can still be stated as a linear program, but the answers will no longer be integers, hence the need for integer programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a scheduling problem we have a set $N$ of $n$ agents, a set $X$ of $m$ discrete and consecutive time slots, a value function $v$ for assigning a combination of time slots to an agent, and a price $q$ to use each time slot for some other purpose (this is optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "The value function says that a value of $w_i$ is generated if the number of time slots assigned to agent $i$ is at least $\\lambda_i$ (some measure of the time needed) before $d_i$ (the deadline).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this problem, where we have 5 hour-long time slots (9AM,10AM,11AM,12PM,1PM), and no alternative uses:\n",

    "#### A more general form of competitive equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets define what competitive equilibrium means in this case. A solution $F$ is in competitive equilibrium for the prices $p$ if and only if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The given assignment at the given prices maximises each agents utility. I.e., $F_i = \\text{argmax}_{T\\subseteq X} (v_i(T)-\\sum_{j|j\\in T}p_j$)\n",
    "- All time slots are at least the reserve price\n",
    "- If a time slot is not assigned, it's value is the reserve price\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, a solution is optimal if this is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this we first note the value of a solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(F)=\\sum_{j|x_j\\in F_\\emptyset} q_j + \\sum_{i\\in N} v_i(F_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, we get the reserve price from any processors which aren't used, then the utility to each person (just the pure benefit of the combination). Applying the last bullet point above gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(F)=\\sum_{j|x_j\\in F_\\emptyset} p_j + \\sum_{i\\in N} v_i(F_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And then adding in (+1 ... -1) for all the used items, rearranging gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(F)=\\sum_{j|x_j\\in X} p_j + \\big[v_i(F_i)-\\sum_{j|j\\in F_i}p_j\\big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This quantity is guaranteed to be maximised given the price, as no individual agent can improve their utiltiy (bullet point 1). Nobody would switch their $F_i$, so the overall quantity must be at maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, arriving at a competitive equilibrium means solving the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, not all problems have a competitive equilibrium. Consider this case involving just the 9AM and 10AM slots, and where the reserve price is $\\$3$:\n",

    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider whether Agent A has both slots or not:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Say agent A has both. Then the combined price must be below $\\$10$, otherwise A would prefer to have nothing. Then at one of the two slots must be less than $\\$5$. But agent B is willing to pay up to $\\$6$ for a single slot, so this is not in equilibrium. Each agent must be assigned a set that maximises their return.\n",
    "2. Say agent A has neither. Then the combined price must be greater than $\\$10$, otherwise A would prefer to buy both. However, B is willing to pay at most $\\$6$ for a slot, and the reserve price for the other is $\\$3$, which is a total of $\\$9$, which is less than $\\$10$. So this is not in equilibrium either. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Theorem:** *A competitive equilibrium will only occur for this problem if any of these options is met:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- All agents want a single timeslot.\n",
    "- Utility is additive across exclusive sets (i.e., $v_i(R)+v_i(T)=v_i(R\\cup T)$.\n",

    "Unfortunately there is no guarantee this algorithm will converge. Sometimes the bidding increment is too small, other times an equilibrium can be missed. We also can't guarantee the solution found when the algorithm terminates is optimal, or even close to optimal. The upside is the algorithm is fairly cheap to run, and will always terminate."
