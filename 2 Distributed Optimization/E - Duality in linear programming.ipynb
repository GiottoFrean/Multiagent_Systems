    "## Duality in linear programming\n",
    "The previous section contained a long-winded description of linear programming. To avoid doing that again this section will be a little shorter. \n",

    "\n",
    "Say I have a set of contstraints / inequalities. One of the things I can do is sum up the coefficients of those constraints for each variable (and the limit), and arrive at an entirely new equation. For instance, if $x_1 + x_2 < 2$ and $x_1 < 1$, then taking them both: $2x_1 + x_2 < 3$. At the same time, I can also multiply constraints by a positive constant ($x_1<2$ and $\\frac{1}{2}x_1<1$ are the same). What this means is we can do a weighted sum of constraints and arrive at a new constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we denote these positive weights as $y$, then the new constraint coefficients are $A^Ty$, and the limit is $b^Ty$. This means:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$x^Tc \\leq b^Ty$$\n",

    "So therefore $b^Ty$ is an upper bound on the problem, given the constraints that $y>0$ and $A^Ty\\geq c$.\n",
