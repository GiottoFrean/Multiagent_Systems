    "### 2.3.1 From contract nets to auction-like optimization\n",
    "In a contract net we have a global problem, made up of a number of tasks. For each agent there is a cost function $c_i(T)$ reflecting the cost of agent $i$ to do all the tasks $T$. We start agents out with random tasks, and want them to swap and exchange them in order to lower the sum of the individual costs. In future chapters we will look at how to do this with agents which are also self-interested. First, we derive a linear progrmaming solution to this problem. \n",
    "### 2.3.2 The assignment problem and linear programming\n",
    "In a (symmetric) assignment problem we have a set $N$ of agents, a set $X$ of objects, a set of possible assignment pairs $M$, and a function $v$ which tells us what the value of an assignment pair is. At the moment we just consider that we have at most 1 object per agent. A valid assignment is then a set of pairs $S\\subseteq M$, which has the property that each each agent $i$ and object $j$ is in at most 1 pair. A feasable assignment is one in which all agents are assigned an object, and an optimal assignment is one in which the sum of the values is maximised. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be expressed as a linear program. We introduce an indicator matrix $x$ where $x_{i,j}=1$ if the pair ($i$,$j$) is selected. Then the linear program is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{maximise} \\quad & \\sum_{i,j\\in M} v(i,j)x_{i,j} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{subject to} \\quad & \\sum_{j} x_{i,j}<=1 \\\\\n",
    "\\text{} \\quad & \\sum_{i} x_{i,j}<=1\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While this might seem incorrect, as this would seem to possibly create partial assignments, in truth the answers turn out to be integers. In fact, every linear program encoding of an assignment problem has an integer solution. Solving a linear program can be done in polynomial time, using the simplex algorithm."
