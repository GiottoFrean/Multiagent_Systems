# Multiagent Systems

This repository contains my notes and explorations while learning from the book Multiagent Systems by Yoav Shoham and Kevin Leyton-Brown. Each folder corresponds to a chapter or topic from the book, with Jupyter notebooks working through the concepts, algorithms, and examples.
